## Detailed Documentation

### Components

Components are the building blocks of the application's user interface. They are located in the `src/components`
directory.

- **ExampleComponent.tsx**: A brief description of what this component does.

### Containers

Containers manage the state and logic for groups of components. They are located in the `src/containers` directory.

- **ExampleContainer.tsx**: A brief description of what this container does.

### Services

Services handle API calls and any related data logic. They are located in the `src/services` directory.

### Utilities

Utility functions that are reused throughout the project are located in the `src/utils` directory.

- **helpers.ts**: Contains various helper functions used across components and containers.

### Backend

#### Models

Mongoose models that define the structure of our MongoDB documents are located in the `server/models` directory.

- **User.ts**: Defines the schema and model for user documents.

#### Routes

Express routes are defined in the `server/routes` directory.

- **userRoutes.ts**: Contains routes related to user operations such as registration and login.

#### Server

The main server setup is located in `server/server.ts`. This file initializes the Express server, connects to the
MongoDB database, and defines middleware.

### Testing

Testing is accomplished using `@testing-library/react` for the frontend, and any Node.js testing framework (like Jest)
for the backend tests.
